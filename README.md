About GoldenSails

The B2B Developer-friendly Ecosystem (Ecosystem) and B2C Consumer-oriented Infrastructure (Infrastructure) are GoldenSailsâ€™ core strengths. The Ecosystem is an environment for developers as it primarily provides developer-supporting tools and commercial services. Likewise, the Infrastructure is a pool of user traffic. On the B2C side, we primarily supply users with exceptional infrastructural services.
